## Project Information
This game was created as a school project and I have come to find a liking in making projects like this where I can let my creativity run wild and manage everything myself.
<br>

I will still most likely stop working on this project after the deadline given by my school, but I might come back to it for Code Optimization or more Features.

## Description / Tutorial
Based on the original Game with a lot more Features for a better User Experience <br>
- Saves the Games you played via via Java Serialization
- You can change the size of the board
- Custom Themes (User input a Color in Hexcode)
- An Algorithm that plays the game for you, simulating 4 moves into the future and then deciding on the ideal Move,
similar to an AI thereÂ´s also a Penalty and Reward System, which helps the Bot deciding on the best possible Action.

### Controls
Either use the Arrow Keys or WASD to move the tiles. <br>
